# bike-ride
This is clone application of Ola and Uber


in the project I have marked places from where one can take up bikes, from user's current location it will navigate to nearest bike point. 
Once user reached under 120m range it will start the QR scanner which is placed over the bike and will get bike's unlock code by fetching through
QR id.
Now user's ride is started timer will start. User can finish ride by going any other bike point.
